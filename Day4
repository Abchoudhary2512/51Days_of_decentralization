The DAO Hack Remedy Forks Ethereum
While the vast majority of stakeholders adopted the change and the fork was implemented, not everyone was on board. As a result, the hard fork resulted in two competing — and now separate — Ethereum blockchains. Those who refused to accept the hard fork that rolled back the blockchain’s history supported the pre-forked version — now known as Ethereum Classic (ETC). The blockchain presently known as Ethereum is the blockchain that implemented the hard fork and altered the blockchain’s history — and the history of blockchain as a whole.

Though the funds stolen from The DAO were restored to its investors, the attacker did not lose out entirely. The pilfered tokens still remained in their possession on the Ethereum Classic chain and were worth around $8.5 million in ETC in the months following the attack.

The DAO hack and subsequent Ethereum hard fork shook the Ethereum community to its core and highlighted major questions about the emerging technology. In retrospect, it’s clear that the decisions made by Vitalik Buterin, Etheruem developers, and the global community ensured the survival of the blockchain in its earliest days. Since The DAO hack, Ethereum has gone on to become an essential pillar of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and decentralized finance.
